# Speech Emotion Recognition
An ML model for detecting the emotion of speech.

# Dataset Used
Toronto emotional speech set (TESS) dataset has been used for training this model. 

# Running the Project
* Import the .ipynb file on either google colab or jupyter notebook.
* Install tensorflow
* Download the dataset from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ejlok1/toronto-emotional-speech-set-tess
* Update the path from which data is read in the code.
* Finally, run the cells of the .ipynb file.
 
# Development
* Jupyter Notebook has been used in developing this model.
